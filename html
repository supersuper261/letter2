          Dear [Recipient],

          I wanted to take a moment to tell you how much you mean to me. Every day I spend with you is a gift, and I cherish each and every moment we share.

          Your smile lights up my world, and your kindness and generosity never cease to amaze me. I am so grateful to have you in my life, and I want you to know that I love you more and more each day.

          With all my heart,
          [Your Name]
        </p>
